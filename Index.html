                            <p>Snowfall in Sindh — sounds more like fantasy but no, there’s one place in Sindh where it really snows in winter, 
                                to the extent that in 2008 the mountains got entirely covered with a layer of snow.

                      Gorakh is a scenic plateau situated at a height of over 5,688 feet and is part of the Kirthar Mountain Range that covers the entire Sindh’s border with Balochistan in the west.
                      in the west of Dadu lies a beautiful place called Gorakh hills Station. It is situated at height of 5668 feet above the sea level and is a part of Kirthar mountain range.  This hill station covers an area of about 2400 acres, out of which 1340 acres belong to Sindh and other 1060 acres in Baluchistan. It serves as gateway between the two Provinces of Pakistan. It provides a unique scenery and surroundings to the nature lovers as it is one of the highest plateau of the Sindh region, 
                      and as well as a picnic and adventure point to the tourists coming to Sindh. Due to its high elevation from the sea level the temperature here is between 15 to 17 degree that drops to -5 degrees in January and February.

                                    court for the royal palace complex of Talpur monarchs of the Khairpur dynasty. Originally it included the ruler's 
                                    chambers along with 16 waiting rooms for courtiers and guest
                                     rooms for royal guests alongside the durbar and dining halls. 
                                     Additionally there was the Hathi Khana for the royal elephant and the horses stables where today there is a mango orchard</p>
               
                                  <p>  This majestic remain of the Talpur Dynasty of Khairpur , is the Faiz Mahal. It is a grand architectural masterpiece. The unique traditional culture and traditional work of art seems to have swept over the real splendour. The details on the walls of the palace are exquisitely designed, exhibiting the fine art of the people of past era.

                                <p>Railway bridge over the Indus river between Rohri and Sukkur in Sindh province, Pakistan. 
                                    The bridge is about 806 feet long, 247 feet high and cost Rs21.6 million.
                                     Ayub Bridge, can be truly declared as one of the prides of Sukkur.
                                      It has served the city for 50 years by providing a strong link for rail traffic between Sukkur and Rohri.
                                      The construction phase of Ayub Bridge was interesting as first of all four huge cemented abutments, two on each side of the river banks, were made.       
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Before the bridges, the transport between Sukkur and Rohri was by boats and steamers. Boatman Mir Mohammad alias Miroo recalled how his father Yar Mohammad used to run a small service between Sukkur and Rohri till the early sixties. “Very few people had cars or motorcycles at that time and therefore motor boats were the only way of communication.” Some people used to cross the River Indus by Lansdowne Bridge on bicycle. The train used to run in the center of the bridge and pedestrians and cyclists used the wooden walkways at both sides.</p>

                                       The mausoleum is located in a prominent and highly visible location in the Jamshed Quarters locality of central Karachi, along the northern edge of the colonial-era core at the end of Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road. The mausoleum is surrounded by a large garden laid out in a neo-Mughal style in the dense central city, with large traffic rotaries at three of its four corners.
                                       The mausoleum was designed in the modernist style popular during the 1960s and 1970s, and has been termed a "traditional monument of a modernist period."[6] It appears simple at a distance, but "exuberant in its use of material and complex in its detailing when viewed" closely.
